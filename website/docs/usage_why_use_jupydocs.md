title: Why use jupydocs?
---
There are already several very good tools that exist for documenting python packages. The most popular tool is [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). So what is wrong with sphinx? Nothing is wrong with sphinx... but jupydocs thinks that making documentation can be easier and more fun:

- sphinx is complicated, you probably spend a lot of time reading the documentation of a documentation generator
- sphinx uses `.rst`, but really everyone loves `.md`
- sphinx is overkill (if you are pandas maybe it is not... but if you are a simple library without hundreds of functions it is overkill)
