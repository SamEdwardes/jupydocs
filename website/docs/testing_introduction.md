The following pages demonstrate how jupydocs renders the documentation for several common libraries, as well as several example functions from the [napolean sphinx extension](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy) documentation. This can help you decided if jupydocs will work for your library, and give you an idea of what to expect.
